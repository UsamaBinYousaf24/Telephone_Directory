# Telephone_Directory

# 📞 Telephone Directory System

A **console-based telephone directory** project developed in **C++**, implementing core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** including **arrays**, **linked lists**, **stacks**, and **queues**, along with **file handling**. The project supports **user and admin interfaces**, enabling management of contacts with features like add, search, modify, delete, and sort.

## 📦 Data Structures Used

| Feature                    | Data Structure |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Contact Storage           | Linked List    |
| Operation History         | Stack          |
| Recently Added Contacts   | Queue          |
| UI Input/Output           | Console (CLI)  |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Compile the code with a C++ compiler that supports Windows headers:
   ```bash
   g++ TelePhone.cpp -o TelePhone.exe
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./TelePhone.exe
   ```

> Note: This code uses `conio.h`, `windows.h`, and ANSI color codes. It runs best on **Windows command prompt**.
